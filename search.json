    "text": "Introduction\nThe people at the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University gathered data on more than 2500 episodes of beach nourishment in the USA since 1925 and offer visualizations and tables on their website. I downloaded the data for North Carolina so that I could look at it in other ways to understand better the scale, cost, and trends related to shore protection and navigation in NC, where I live.\nGiven the significant growth in coastal population and development over the last 50 years1, rising sea levels2, coastal land subsistence3, and increases in the severity and impact of storms4, I expected to find more nourishment episodes in recent years, in more places, with more volume of sand moved. In which case, if the cost per volume for beach nourishment increased or remained roughly similar over the decades (in constant dollars), increasing number of episodes (and thus volume) would translate into increasing cost.\nIndeed that is the story in the data… with some interesting dynamics within the larger trend.\nNote that beach erosion and the natural filling of near-shore navigation channels create many other costs born by private and governmental groups which are not reflected here, including houses collapsing into the surf, and moving lighthouses away from encroaching shoreline.",

    "section": "Explanation of terms",
    "text": "Explanation of terms\n“Beach nourishment” refers to placing sand taken from elsewhere onto a beach or dune, either to replace eroded sand, or to make good use of sand removed while dredging to improve navigation channels. In North Carolina nearly all episodes are for shore protection, navigation, or emergency beach repair.\nI reprint the following definitions found at https://beachnourishment.wcu.edu/glossary.\nJustification: The primary reason why a beach was nourished. These include:\n\nBypass: Artificially moving sand from an updrift beach to a downdrift beach to bypass a natural or artificial obstruction such as an inlet or jetty.\nCoastal Impact Assistance Program: Federal grant funds derived from federal offshore lease revenues to the oil-producing states of Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas for conservation, protection, or restoration of coastal areas.\nDemonstration: A US Army Corps of Engineers experimental effort that places sand in an offshore location, rather than directly on a beach.\nEcosystem Restoration: An effort to reestablish or improve coastal habitat that has been degraded or damaged by natural or human activities.\nEmergency: Designed to create an artificial beach berm to provide a minimum level of protection to vulnerable coastal development, usually post-storm. All Federal nourishment episodes classified as Emergency are funded through FEMA or the US Army Corps of Engineers.\nEmergency Dune: Designed to construct an artificial dune to provide a minimum level of protection to vulnerable coastal development, usually post-storm.\nNavigation: Sediment (known as dredge spoil) resulting from a navigation-related dredging effort is placed on a beach rather than dumped offshore or in an upland location.\nSection 111: Mitigation of shoreline damages attributable to Federal navigation structures (jetties).\nShore Protection: Nourishment episodes undertaken for the primary purpose of reducing storm-related damage to static human economic development placed behind dynamic shorelines.\n\nLength: The linear distance of shoreline upon which sediment has been emplaced, measured in feet.\nPrimary Funding Source: The public or private entity providing the majority of the funding for a nourishment episode. These include:\n\nFederal: Tax dollars spent by the US Army Corps of Engineers or FEMA.\nLocal: Tax dollars spent by the administration of a particular town or district with representatives elected by those who live there.\nPrivate: Funds provided by a non-governmental entity having no official or public role or position.\nState: Funds provided by members or representatives of a unit of government that specifically makes and enforces laws for a state.\n\nVolume: Volume is the quantity of sand emplaced on a beach during a beach nourishment episode measured in cubic yards.\nYear Completed: The year in which a nourishment episode was completed. Beach nourishment typically commences in the late fall/early winter due to environmental and ecological concerns. As a result, nourishment episodes usually begin at the end of the year and wrap-up early the next year.",

If number of episodes per year (D) had not declined in the latest years, overall costs would be higher (see Figure 1.12).\nIs the cost per volume increasing, because nourishment projects undertaken in recent years are more challenging (for example: greater distances between dredging and beaches)? Or are environmental regulations more expensive to comply with? Or is there limited competition among a small set of contractors bidding on nourishment projects? Or other reasons?\nAnd why have the number of episodes per year declined in the most recent years? Perhaps because a major hurricane has not hit NC since Florence in 2018.

Some level of investment can be justified on economic terms–the coastal economy is based on tourism–but how much?\n\n\nShow the code\nd_not_included &lt;- d_combined |&gt;\n  filter(adjusted_cost_2022 == 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(cum_cost = 0)\n\ndta_for_plot &lt;- d_combined_with_est |&gt;\n  arrange(year_completed) |&gt;\n  mutate(cum_cost = cumsum(adjusted_cost_2022_est),\n         .by = primary_funding_source) |&gt;\n  mutate(primary_funding_source = factor(primary_funding_source, \n                                         levels = c(\"Private\", \"Local\", \"State\", \"Federal\"))\n         )\n\np1 &lt;- dta_for_plot |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_completed, y = cum_cost)) +\n  geom_area(aes(fill = primary_funding_source),\n           alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_rug(data = d_not_included,\n           aes(x = year_completed, y = cum_cost, color = primary_funding_source),\n           sides = \"b\",\n           outside = TRUE,\n           alpha = 0.3,\n           position = position_jitter(),\n           show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(position = \"inside\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\") +\n  theme(legend.position.inside = c(0.2, 0.8)) +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"A: Total cumulative\", \n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    fill = \"Primary funding\\nsource\"\n  )\n\np2 &lt;- dta_for_plot |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_completed, y = cum_cost)) +\n  geom_area(aes(fill = justification),\n           alpha = 0.6,\n           show.legend = TRUE) +\n  geom_rug(data = d_not_included,\n           aes(x = year_completed, y = cum_cost, color = justification),\n           sides = \"b\",\n           outside = TRUE,\n           alpha = 0.3,\n           position = position_jitter(),\n           show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02))) +\n  facet_wrap( ~primary_funding_source) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"B: Total cumulative by funding source\", \n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    color = \"Justification\",\n    fill = \"Justification\"\n  )\n\np1 + p2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = glue(\"Most funding comes from federal sources\",\n                 \"\\nwhile local sources have grown a lot since about 2000\"),\n    subtitle = glue(\"Estimated cumulative cost in 2022 dollars\"),\n    caption = paste0(my_caption, \"\\n\", my_caption_missing_append)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Cumulative cost by primary funding sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relatively small amounts of state funding have gone to different communities each time:\n\n\nShow the code\nd_combined_with_est |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  select(place, year_completed, primary_funding_source, justification, adjusted_cost_2022_est, est_cost, volume_cy) |&gt;\n  filter(primary_funding_source == \"State\") |&gt;\n  arrange(year_completed) |&gt;\n  select(-primary_funding_source) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(md(\"**State funding**\")) |&gt;\n  tab_options(table.font.size = 10) |&gt;\n  fmt_currency(columns = adjusted_cost_2022_est, \n               decimals = 0,\n               suffixing = TRUE) |&gt;\n  fmt_number(columns = volume_cy,\n             decimals = 0,\n             suffixing = TRUE) |&gt;\n  cols_align(columns = est_cost,\n             align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  sub_missing(columns = everything())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState funding\n\n\nplace\nyear_completed\njustification\nadjusted_cost_2022_est\nest_cost\nvolume_cy\n\n\n\n\nCarolina Beach\n1956\nUnknown\n$1M\nY\n200K\n\n\nWrightsville Beach\n1956\nUnknown\n$220K\nY\n35K\n\n\nTopsail\n2016\nNavigation\n$3M\n\n130K\n\n\nAtlantic Beach\n2017\nShore Protection\n$11M\n\n621K\n\n\nOak Island\n2021\nShore Protection\n$16M\n\n728K\n\n\nOcean Isle Beach\n2022\nShore Protection\n$9M\n\n700K\n\n\nEmerald Isle\n2024\nNavigation\n$3M\n\n200K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes sense to me that the federal government is funding navigation improvements, since it has constitutional obligations related to interstate commerce and the regulation of waterways.\nMore surprising is the growth of locally-funded shore protection episodes, which in 30 years has nearly reached what the federal government spent in the last 80 years. Can this continue? What stress is this putting on local community budgets and balance sheets? How are they paying for it? Will the trend continue?

So using \\(median(cost\\_cy) * volume\\_cy\\) for each place (pct_diff_med_cy_cost_times_cy) is a better estimate than simply using \\(median(cost)\\) for each place (pct_diff_med_cost).\nAs an error check, the following plots compare the two estimation methods with the actual costs for those episodes that include costs (and thus in these cases I did not use estimated values in plots above). I assume the performance of the estimators is similar for episodes lacking cost data.\n\n\nShow the code\ndta_for_plot &lt;- d_combined_with_est |&gt;\n  select(place, year_completed, adjusted_cost_2022, adjusted_cost_cy, med_adjusted_cost_2022, med_adjusted_cost_cy, \n         adjusted_cost_2022_new) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(adjusted_cost_2022),\n         !is.na(adjusted_cost_cy)) |&gt;\n  mutate(pct_diff_med_cost = (med_adjusted_cost_2022 - adjusted_cost_2022) / adjusted_cost_2022,\n         pct_diff_med_cy_cost_times_cy = (adjusted_cost_2022_new - adjusted_cost_2022) / adjusted_cost_2022\n) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = contains(\"pct_diff\"),\n               names_to = \"pct\",\n               values_to = \"value\")\n\nd_fun_a &lt;- dta_for_plot |&gt;\n  filter(pct == \"pct_diff_med_cy_cost_times_cy\") |&gt;\n  pull(value) |&gt;\n  ecdf()\nprob_a &lt;- d_fun_a(1) - d_fun_a(-1)\n\nd_fun_b &lt;- dta_for_plot |&gt;\n  filter(pct == \"pct_diff_med_cost\") |&gt;\n  pull(value) |&gt;\n  ecdf()\nprob_b &lt;- d_fun_b(1) - d_fun_b(-1)\n\np1 &lt;- dta_for_plot |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 0, 1), \n             lty = 2, linewidth = 0.15, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(aes(value, color = pct, fill = pct),\n               alpha = 0.1,\n               show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.005, 0.02))) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"firebrick\", \"dodgerblue\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(NA, 10)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"A: Density\",\n    x = \"Difference in estimate and original data as percent of original data\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  )\n\np2 &lt;- dta_for_plot|&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1, 0, 1), \n             lty = 2, linewidth = 0.15, alpha = 0.5) +\n  stat_ecdf(aes(value, color = pct),\n            pad = FALSE,\n            alpha = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.005, 0.02)),\n                     labels = label_percent()) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"firebrick\", \"dodgerblue\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 3))) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(NA, 10)) +\n  expand_limits(y = 0) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"B: ECDF\",\n    x = \"Difference in estimate and original data as percent of original data\",\n    y = \"Percent of all episodes\\nwithout missing data\"\n  )\n\ncaption_extra2 &lt;- glue(\"\\nPlots truncated to make them more readible (`pct_diff_med_cost` extends to 40x).\")\n\np1 + p2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = glue(\"The selected estimation method is good enough\",\n                 \"\\nand is superior to a simpler method I used initially\"),\n    subtitle = glue(\"Selected method captures {percent(prob_a)} of the episode values within ±1.\", \n                    \"\\nand avoids large errors present when using median episode cost.\",\n                    \"\\nMedian episode cost captures {percent(prob_b)} and generates more extreme outliers.\", \n                    \"\\nDashed lines are ±1 a.k.a. estimate off by 100%.\"),\n    caption = paste0(my_caption, \"\\n\", caption_extra2)\n  ) +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\",\n              axes = \"collect\") &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: The selected method of cost estimation is good enough",

I mention them here in case they are of interest to someone else.\n\n2.5.1 NC Beach GIS data\nhttps://data-nconemap.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/560da2d6c7f64b188841946854176cd0/explore\nhttps://data-nconemap.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nconemap::2016-orthoimagery/about\nSummary\nThis service depicts true color imagery for the counties representing the coastal plain regions of North Carolina. The imagery has a pixel resolution of 6 inches and was flown in the beginning of 2016 as part of the North Carolina Orthoimagery Program.\nNOTE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE IMAGERY BY USING THE MAP OR DOWNLOAD TOOLS ON THIS ARCGIS HUB ITEM PAGE. IT WILL RESULT IN A PIXELATED ORTHOIMAGE. INSTEAD, DOWNLOAD THE IMAGERY BY TILE OR BY COUNTY MOSAIC (2010 - current year).\nThis service depicts true color imagery for the counties representing the coastal plain regions of North Carolina. The imagery has a pixel resolution of 6 inches and was flown in the beginning of 2016. The RMSE is 1.5 ft X and Y. Individual pixel values may have been altered during image processing. Therefore, this service should be used for general reference and viewing. Image analysis requiring examination of individual pixel values is discouraged. To view the latest imagery for any location in the state, customers should use the “Orthoimagery_Latest” image service (https://services.nconemap.gov/secure/rest/services/Imagery/Orthoimagery_Latest/ImageServer).\n\n\n2.5.2 Shorelines of the central North Carolina (NCcentral) coastal region used in shoreline change analysis\nhttps://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58b8913ee4b01ccd5500c312 offers NCcentral_shorelines.zip\nPurpose This dataset includes shorelines from 158 years ranging from 1852 to 2010 in central North Carolina’s coastal region from Cape Hatteras to Cape Lookout. Shorelines were compiled from topographic survey sheets (T-sheets; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)), Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) maps (NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)), and lidar (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)/NOAA/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USGS/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), USGS/NOAA/National Park Service (NPS)). Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project. Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.3. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.
